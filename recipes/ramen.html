    <h2> ramen History</h2>
    <p>Ramen, a staple of Japanese fast food, has roots in Chinese noodle dishes that were introduced to Japan in the 19th century. It evolved into a unique Japanese dish, featuring wheat noodles in a flavorful soup, often flavored with soy sauce, miso, or other seasonings. Instant ramen, a popular form of ramen, was invented in 1958 by Momofuku Ando, who developed the first mass-produced instant ramen, later introducing Cup Noodles in 1971. </p>
